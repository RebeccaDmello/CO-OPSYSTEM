# React-SpringBoot

Co-Op system is basically a SpringBoot-React application. It's front-end is developed using React and Back-end is SpringBoot.
A Database file is provided which should be exported in MySQL and it will create the tables and necessary fields[coopsystem.sql].
The name of database is coopsystem

```
Softwares needed to run the system:-

IDE- Visual Studio Code - React Code, IntelliJ - SpringBoot Code
Softwares - React, Node, MySQL, Xampp

```
Step 1: Structure of the application will be as follows 
The project should look like this: frontend folder should be started with Visual Studio Code, Intellij should be used to open the coop folder and coopsystem.sql is the database file which has to be imported in your MySQL with the database name as coopsystem

Step 4: Getting started with 'frontend' folder
NOTE: there is a node_modules folder inside the frontend folder, to install node you first need to have node downloaded on your PC and then you have start visual studio code
and use the terminal inside visual studio to use the following command 
-npm i
-npm i axios, cors, react, react-dom, react-router-dom, react-scripts, react-validation, validator, web-vitals

Follow the following steps to get an idea about how it works

Step 5: Refer to package.json file inside the project and install all the necessary node packages with the help of node using terminal inside your Visual Studio if any issue persists

Step 6: Refer to same process of installing node_module in your coop folder

Step 7: After node_modules have been installed in coop and frontend folder, you are required to start your IntelliJ and start SpringBoot Application by clicking on the run button. You also need to concurrently start your frontend application by using the terminal and type the command "npm start". It will automatically start your frontend in the browser.
